# Crop_Price_Pridiction
This project aims to predict market crop prices using historical mandi data such as crop type, variety, location (state, district, market), and arrival quantity. The model is built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras, and trained on a clean, preprocessed dataset derived from multiple Excel files.
